# Robot-walking
## Task :the steps to control servo motors to create the walking motion for a robot
### Walking motion algorithm for the robot

#### 1. System initialization
   - Connect the servo motors to the controller (such as Arduino).
   - Make sure all electrical components are connected properly.

#### 2. Definition of variables
   - Define the number of servo motors.
   - Determine the initial angles for each motor.

#### 3. Initializing the engines
   - Use a motor control library (such as Servo.h in Arduino) to configure the motors.    

#### 4. Basic movement function
   - Create a function to move the legs (lift, push, place).      

#### 5. Main course
   - Create a key loop to replicate the walking motion.

  #### 6. Test and improve
   - Run the code and test the robot's movement.
   - Adjust angles and time as needed to improve balance and smoothness.
